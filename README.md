In progress music playing application

Purpose is to have a seamless uninterrupted music experience where you can listen to what you want, when you want, and however much
you want with no need for wifi/data, ads, or fees.

Current functionality
  Create mp3, add song to queue, play select song, play queue to end (reloop queue again option), start session, 
  quit session (when queue reaches final song)
  
  To be added: Rewind to prev song or skip, remove song, song search in queue for convenience of large song sets, 
     database store of users and song lists, user sign in, handle cases of wrong inputs for commands (for an example such as 
     playing queue when no songs added: this currently ends the session).
  
Instructions of use:
    Commands instructions follow with starting the application
    In general terms you need to convert desired songs through YouTube into mp3 files. Add the mp3 files into the project folder.
    In the running session add songs or select to create mp3 and then after following the commands instructions press p to play and select 
    which song of the queue to begin with. After the last song in the queue is reached you'll be prompted whether to loop again and play 
    from the beginning or quit. 
    
    There are some example songs that are in this project that is how it should appear. Title of song/string to be entered into the 
    input for the scanner is everything except for the .mp3 
    
    This is a work in progress still and other functionality, optimalities, and conveniences will be developed.
    Available as a cross platform application later in the future.
